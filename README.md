# Java Practice Repository

Welcome to this Java Practice section! This repository contains a collection of Java programs organized by data structure and algorithm topics. Each program demonstrates core concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 📂 `array/`
This folder contains programs related to **array manipulation and searching** algorithms.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `binary_search.java` | Implementation of binary search algorithm for sorted arrays |
| `search_in_array.java` | Linear search and various search techniques in arrays |
| `two_sum.java` | Find two elements in an array that sum to a target value |
| `sum.java` | Calculate sum of array elements and related problems |
| `reverse_array.java` | Reverse an array in-place and other reversal techniques |
| `roate_k_pos_right.java` | Rotate array elements k positions to the right |

| `freqeunce.java` | Count frequency of elements in an array |

### 📂 `set_hash_map/`
This folder contains programs related to **hash maps, sets, and hash-based data structures**.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `anagram.java` | Check if two strings are anagrams using hash maps |
| `first_non_repeating_char.java` | Find the first non-repeating character in a string |
| `first_repeating_element_in_array.java` | Find the first repeating element in an array |
| `freq_each_ele.java` | Calculate frequency of each element using hash map |
| `rem_duplicate.java` | Remove duplicate elements from arrays/collections |

## 🎯 Topics Covered

- **Array Operations**: Searching, sorting, rotation, and manipulation
- **Hash Maps & Sets**: Frequency counting, duplicate detection, and lookups
- **String Processing**: Anagrams, character analysis
- **Algorithm Concepts**: Binary search, two-pointer techniques, hash-based solutions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to the desired folder
